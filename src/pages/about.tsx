## About

This dashboard is made with love by members of the Ethereum community, in partnership with Flipside Crypto. We hope it serves as a valuable window into high-level metrics that display the vitality and growth of the optimism.io.

  


  
### Methodology

-   Data is drawn from a combination of Flipside Crypto’s Ethereum tables and existing APIs.
    
-   For charts where data comes from Flipside’s data, a link to the underlying query is provided in the Settings gear wheel at the top right of each visualization.
    
-   By default, charts are set to refresh hourly
